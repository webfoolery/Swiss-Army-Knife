Version 4.2 
Code Insertion has been seen to affect things that were unforeseen... I saw an XML sitemap from JSitemap PRO (com_jmap) where a Javascript insertion was placed inside their XML sitemap. For now I've excluded Code Insertion on any pages where the 'format' URL variable is set, eg. https://yoursite.com/index.php?option=com_jmap&view=sitemap&format=xml

Version update 4.1.1
Fixes image path for Twitter & OpenGraph meta tags. Joomla 4 introduced a system of appending metadata to image paths that are created from the Joomla Media Manager. These new paths don't seem to render on social media when sharing the link to the page. This update reverts the image path in the meta tags back to the standard path.

Version update 4.1.0
Fixes missing language strings on backend. Identified cause of long standing issue where all language strings in the ini file had to be prepended with COM_SOMETHING and suffixed with an extra _FIELD_LABEL. This was driving me mad! Turns out I was using a language string in the name of the fieldsets in the XML file but you can actually add a label to the fieldset with the text (language string) that you want and that parses exactly as you type it. Hallelula!

Version update 4.0.0
Code modifications to make the plugin suitable to Joomla!4.x
Improvements to the OpenGraph & Twitter metadata. They are now only injected if they don'e exist, so other components can set them more accurately if needed

2022-04-02  
Version update 1.9  
Fixes a mistake in last version where hardcoded links to a specific site caused OpenGraph data for that site to be embedded into the plugin code. This meant that any sites with the plugin installed were displaying OG data for that site instead of its own OG data  
Adds a dedicated OpenGraph metadata editor for adding content to the `Generator` section
